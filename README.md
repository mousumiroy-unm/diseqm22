# diseqm22
The two Matlab scripts here are use to solve nondimensional Eqns 5 and 6 in the Solid Earth paper:

Roy, M., Assessing the role of thermal disequilibrium in the evolution of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary: An idealized model of heat exchange during 
channelized melt-transport, Solid Earth, se-2022-13, 2022

These are for the sinusoidal perturbation, but may be easily modified to make a step-function or a tanh-pulse with a specified width
